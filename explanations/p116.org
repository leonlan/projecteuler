* Explanation
Let $R[n]$, $G[n]$ and $B[n]$ be the number of ways that a row of size $n$ can be placed with red, green or blue tiles respectively. For each color, the recurrence relation is fairly simple. Let's demonstrate it for blue tiles.

Blue tiles are size 4. So the way that any row of size smaller than 4 can be filled with blue tiles is 0. For any row of size n larger than 4, we denote it with $B[n]$. Then we get the following recurrence relation: $$B[n] = 1 + B[n-1] + B[n-4].$$ In other words, the number of ways that we can fill a row of size $n$ with blue tiles is equal to 1 plus the number of ways we can fill a row of size $n+1$. Additionally, we need to take into account $B[n-4]$.
