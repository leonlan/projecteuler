* Introduction
We iterate over all perfect squares and check if it progressive. This way we only need to check about $10^{6}$ numbers and the only step that remains is finding an algorithm to check for progressiveness.

* Progressive numbers
The first observation is that $d$, $q$ and $r$ cannot be zero, because otherwise the numbers won't form a geometric sequence (unless they are all zero, but that is not possible). Note that clearly $ 1\leq d \leq n$, and if $q$ is zero then $d > n$, which is also excluded. But what are the implications of $r$ not being equal to zero? Excluding zero remainders means that we do can directly exclude all positive divisors of $n$.


* Check up to sqrt(n)

* Geometric sequence
