* Project Euler
#+html: <img src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/leonlan.png">
Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of challenging mathematics and computer science problems intended to be solved with programming. Starting since November 2018, I have solved over 160 problems in total (top 0.4%), covering topics such as number theory, combinatorics and dynamic programming. It's an incredible fun way to learn about algorithms, discrete mathematics and number theory (and much more!).

This repository contains all my solutions for Project Euler sorted by programming language. Feel free to add me on Project Euler. My friend key is: ~942079_iEDMDDXDe13LYMmzlReee7a2IXghArkI~.

I write most of my solutions in Python. In some cases, I have written code in different languages in order to learn a new language. I am currently still rewriting my Python files to have consistent formatting across all solutions.

* Resources
There are many great resources that have helped me to solve Project Euler problems. I believe that looking at these resources is beneficial, especially if I know that there is some mathematical/programming technique I didn't know about before. Here is a shortlist of resources that I deem most valuable:
- [[https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions][ProjectNayuki]] :: Over 200+ solutions mostly written in Python.
- [[https://euler.stephan-brumme.com/][Stephan Brumme]] :: Over 300+ solutions including explanations.
- [[https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions][Lucky Toilet]] :: All numerical answers to Project Euler.
