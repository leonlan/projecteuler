    "Note the following:\n",
    "* If we consider n = 0, then we have $b$ for the quadratic expression, so $b$ must be prime!\n",
    "* If we consider n = 1, then we have $1+a+b$ for the quadratic expression. Since this must be prime, it must also be odd, which implies that $a+b$ is even. Since $b$ is prime it is also odd, so $a$ must be odd as well. Now we consider two cases: 1) $a$ is postive or 2) $a$ is negative. If $a$ is positive, then we consider all odd numbers for $a < 1000$. If $a$ is negative, we must take care that the quadratic expression is not negative. Hence, we have that $1 + a + b > 0$ which implies $a > -(b + 1)$ or $-a < b+1$. "
