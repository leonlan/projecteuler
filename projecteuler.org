** Solved problems

*** Problem 69: Totient maximum
Can be solved analytically. Otherwise, use a totient sieve.

*** Problem 70: Totient permutation
Use a totient sieve to solve this problem.

*** Problem 74: Digit factorial chains
This type of problem is solved using a cache, which keeps track of intermediate results. Without a cache, brute-forcing would be ridiculously expensive.


*** Problem 92: Square digit chains
This type of problem is best solved using a cache.b
