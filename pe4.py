Problem:
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution:
To consider all the products of two 3-digit numbers , we need to consider at most
900*899/2 unique combinations of such 3-digit numbers (handshake problem). 
Furthermore, it is best to start at the highest 3-digit numbers (999) and count
down to 100, since we are looking for the largest palindrome.
