    "We can use a shortest path algorithm to find the minimal path from top left (source) to bottom right (target). In order to do so, we need to formulate the matrix as a directed graph. Let's take a small matrix as an easy example to construct a directed graph:\n",

    "## Construction of a directed graph \n",
    "Let $G$ be a directed graph. The number of nodes is equal to the number of elements in the matrix + 1, where the + 1 is necessary to include the source node. Moreover, we denote the nodes with tuples $\\{(s,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), \\dots, (2,1), (2,2)\\}$, where each tuple $(i,j)$ corresponds to the $i+1,j+1$-th element of the matrix and $(s,0)$ is the source node. Mathematically speaking, the top-left element in the matrix is $a_{11}$, but since Python starts indexing with 0, this indexing is more convenient. Hence, the node $(0,0)$ corresponds to the matrix element $a_{11}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we construct the edges of $G$. Note that we only construct directed edges in this example. First, observe that we can only move to the right and down in the matrix, so we need to construct an edge from element to its right neighbour and its bottom neighbour. Hence, for each node $(i, j)$, we construct an edge from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j+1)$ (right neighbour) and a node from $(i,j)$ to $(i+1,j)$ (bottom neighbour). The length of the edge ($(i,j)$, $(k,l)$) corresponds to the matrix value of $(k,l)$. Furthermore, we add just one edge from node $(s,0)$ to node $(0,0)$ with the length of the matrix elements $a_{11}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, node $(0,0)$ will have an edge to node $(0,1)$ with length $200$ and an edge to node $(1,0)$ with length $50$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we only construct an edge if the neighbour exists (so for node $(2,2)$, there exists no right nor bottom neighbour and hence we do not add any edges.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the graph construction. "
