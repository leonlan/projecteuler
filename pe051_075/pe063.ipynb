    "We know that the length of $10^{n}$ has $n+1$ digits for any positive integer n. Hence, only for the integers $1, 2, \\dots, 9$ to the power of $n$ might result in a $n$ digit number. \n",

    "Our goal is now as follows: given the power $k$, what is the smallest integer below 10 such that its power has $k$ digits? Is there a power $k$ for which there exists no such integer? The answer to the last question will give us an upper bound for the powers that we need to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "By pencil and paper, we found that $9^{21}$ has $21$ digits, but $9^{22}$ also has $21$ digits. That means that for any power  above 21, there exists no integer such that its $n$-th power also has $n$ digits."
